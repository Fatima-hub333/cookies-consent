"It's a process of analyzing raw data in order to draw out meaningful, actionable insights."It's a form of business intelligence, enabling companies and organizations to make smart decisions on what the data is telling them.

Data Analytics encompasses the extraction (or collection) of raw data, the preparation and subsequent of that data, and stroytelling - sharing key insights from the data, using them to explain or predict certain scenarios and outcomes, and to inform decisions, strategies, and next steps.

Data Analytics replaces guesswork with data-driven insights. It helps you make sense of the past and predict future trends and behaviors, leaving you much better equipped to make smart decisions.

{What Does a Data Analyst Do?}
Any kind of data analysis usually starts with a specific problem you want to solve, or a question you need to answer - for example, "Why did we lose so many customers in the last quarter?" or "Why are pateints dropping out of their therapy programs at the halfway mark?"

Define the question -> Collect the Data -> Clean the Data ->
Analyze the Data -> Create Visualizations -> Share your findings

- Degine your question or problem statement
- Collect the necessary raw data
- Clean the data so that it's ready for analysis
- Analyze the data
- Create Visualizations
- Share your findings

At each stage, data analysts use a range of different tools -  such as Microsoft Excel for Data wrangling and Tableau for data visualizations. As a data analyst you're the bridge between incomprehensible raw data and useful insights. In addtion to actually analyzing data, you may also be responsible for building databases and dashboards, ensuring data quality and best practices, and maintaining relevant documentation.
