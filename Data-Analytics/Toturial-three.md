Now you are going to start gleaning valuable insights throught exploratory data analysis, namely, using descriptive statistics and pivot table. The goal of this tutorial is to learn about descriptive statistics and practice calculating the mean, median and range for certain variables. You will then get familiar with pivot tables to gain further insights from your data. In this tutorial, you will:

- Calculate descriptive statistics
- Create pivot tables using different variables
- Answer four of five main questions about the dataset for stakeholders

Exploratory data analysis is an initial investigation of your dataset where you seek to understand and summarize its main characteristics. EDA is helpful because it helps you to understand how your data is structured, to spot potential patterns and trends, and to catch any anomalies. EDA is also important for determining if the methods of analysis you are planning to use later on are actually appropriate for your dataset.

[What are descriptive statistics?]
Descriptive statistics helps you to summarize or describe the characteristics of your dataset in a meaningful way.The three main types of descriptive statistics are:
- Frequency Distribution, which tells you how frequently (i.e how many times) a certain value occurs within your dataset.
- Measures of Central Tendency, which estimate the middle or average values within your dataset. i.e Mean, Median & Mode.
- Measures of Variability help you gauge how much variability or "spread" there is within your dataset, in other words how spread out the values are. Measures of variability are range, standard deviation, and variance.
