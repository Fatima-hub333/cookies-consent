What Data Cleaning is and why does it matter?Why its important for data analysis?
As a data analyst, you'll recieve data from a variety of sources. This data come in all different romats and, more often than not, it will comprise what's known as "dirty" data. In other words, it won't be ready for analysis straight off the bat--you'll need to clean it first.

{What is dirty data?}
Dirty data is essentially any data that needs to be manipulated or worked on in some way before it can be analyzed. Some types of dirty data include;
- Incomplete Data - for example, a spreadsheet with missing values that would be relevant for your analysis. If you're looking at the relationship between customer age and number of monthly purchases, you'll need data for both of these variables. If some customer ages are missing, you're dealing with incomlete data.
- Duplicate Data: for example, records that appear twice (or multiple times) throughout the same dataset. This can occur if you're combining data from multiple sources or databases.
- Inconsistent or inaccurate Data: data that is outdated or contains structural errors such as typos, inconsistent capitalization, and irregular naming conventions.Say you have a dataset categorized as "P" or "F". Both labels mean the same thing, but the naming convention is inconcictent, leaving the data rather messy.

{Garbage in, Garbage out: The importance of data cleaning}
GIGO stems from the word of computer science, and simply means that if you put flawed data in, you'll get falwed results out.

In Data analytics, clean, quality data is essential to running meaningful and realible analyses. Just as you wouldn't build a house without first laying a good foundation, you can't analyze your data without cleaning it first. Get the data cleaning stage right and you'll create something strong, reliable and long-lasting. 

Working with dirty data is not only bad practice, it can be extremely costly in the long run. As a data analyst, you need to be confident in the conclusions you draw and the advice you give-- and that's really only possible if you've cleaned your data properly.

What are some key steps in the data cleaning process?
- Delete Unnecessary Columns
- Identify & remove duplicates
- Deal with missing data
- Remove unwanted outliers
- Fix inconsistencies
clean a dataset using a variety of methods, preparaing it for analysis.
