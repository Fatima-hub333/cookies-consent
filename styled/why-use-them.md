- Automatic Critical CSS : keep track of which components are rendered. Combined with code splitting, this means your users load the least amount of code necessary.

- No Clas name bugs: Styled-components generate unique class names for your styles which means no duplicates or overlaps.

- Easy to find CSS: Styled-components make it super easy to find your CSS, as every bit of styling is lied to a specific component.


- Dynamic Styling: Adapting the styling of a component based on its props or a global theme.


- Automatic Vendor Prefixing: Write CSS the way you know and love, and let the package do its magic.
