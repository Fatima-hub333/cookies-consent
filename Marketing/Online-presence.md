**Marketing Your Online Presence**
OK, so you’ve established your online home, and now you’re looking for ways to bring more customers to your virtual front door.

Let’s discuss some great strategies to do just that using search engines, other websites, social media and email.

So let’s talk about you, how are you going to get customers to find you online?

There are a few ways to do it using digital. Let’s start with search engines. When people type something in a search engine, they’re letting it know exactly what they are looking for.

If you offer relevant services and products, search engines will show your business in the search results. Now, there are two main ways you can use search engines, and we’ve got lots of info to share on both.

The first is search engine optimisation, or SEO, which helps you promote your business in the unpaid search results.

The second is search engine marketing, or SEM, which lets you buy ad space in the search results. SEO is all about getting your site in front of the right people who are searching for your products and services.

Now, there are lots of ways to do this, we’ll explain them in detail later on, but the key is knowing what words people actually type in — the keywords. They are the most relevant words to your business.

Understanding these will help you improve how you show up when these words are searched.

SEM, on the other hand, is when businesses pay to advertise to people searching for specific keywords online.

Most major search engines use an auction system, where lots of different businesses compete to show their ads by bidding on the keywords they’d like to target.

Search is a great way to reach people, but we do lots more on the Internet. We read news, check sports scores, browse recipes, watch videos and generally browse lots and lots of interesting content across the web.

Alongside all of this content you might see ads. This is called display advertising.

Display ads appear everywhere online, and come in many formats like text, images, video, and ads you can click on and interact with.

They can be a great way to get your message out there and you’re able to choose the people you want to see your ads, and the websites and pages you’d like them to appear on.

Social media sites like Facebook or Twitter are another option for boosting awareness of your business, and they’re especially useful for building relationships with customers.

On most networks you’ll create pages or profiles for your business. You can then connect with lots of people by starting meaningful conversations and sharing content you’ve created whilst growing your business’ online social life.

Before we wrap this up, let’s not forget one more pretty important way businesses can use digital: email marketing.

We’re not talking about junk email, or “spam” that clutters up your inbox, but sending relevant information and offers to people who have already said they’d like to hear from you.

You can get people to sign up, or “opt in” to receive emails from you. Then the rest is up to you. You can send coupons to people who have made an appointment on your site, advertise special events, or promote sale items.
Knowing all the ways you can find people online — and knowing how they can find you — can help launch your business big-time.

The more types of digital marketing you try, the more opportunities you’ll have to reach your most valuable customers, wherever they happen to be in the digital world.

Your first steps in online success: 

Hey! By now, you know how important it is to figure out what you want to get out of digital, how to establish your online presence, and start using digital marketing to drive people to your digital home.

But it’s also important to make sure that your digital plan is geared toward the long haul. Let’s go over a few ways to do that: setting realistic expectations, tracking your results and adapting to changes in technology and your industry. The first thing to remember: don’t expect too much too soon. It can take a bit of time to set up your digital presence and get noticed online.

So if you’re a hairdresser launching your very first website, your online shampoo sales probably aren’t going to go through the roof straight away.

It takes time for search engines to find you, and for you to implement and improve your digital marketing plan. So, try not to set unrealistic goals you’re unlikely to meet.

A crucial part of any online plan is to measure what you’re doing and make sure it’s working. This is called ‘analytics,’ and it can show you how people are finding your website and what they do when they get there.

We’ve got lots of videos that dive into the details of analytics, but generally, knowing where your online visitors come from can help you figure out which of your marketing campaigns are working and which ones aren’t.

If you know what people do once they’re on your website, it can help you figure out if your investment in digital is working.

For example, in your hair salon, you don’t just want people to find your homepage, you might want them to do lots of things like: watch your clever how-to videos, make appointments, get driving directions to your shop, or actually buy something. Tracking what people do on your site can help you to understand what’s working and what’s not, so you can make changes and continually improve what you’re doing. A final point to mention: it’s important to remember that the online world is constantly changing. New tools, technologies and tactics pop up pretty much daily. So a good plan combines the basic concepts that don’t change that often, with forward-thinking to keep up with the latest and greatest.

Similarly, when things change in your industry, make sure your online world is kept up to date.

Are you offering the latest hot trends in hairstyling? If hair dyes become the next big thing, you can quickly update your adverts to show customers what you can do.

To set yourself up for success online, you need to look before you leap. And don’t stop looking! A good plan will consider three things: first, know your online goals, and set yourself realistic expectations. Next, use analytics to track and measure what you’re doing and how it’s working. And last, always keep up-to-date and adapt to changes in technology and the industry you work in. If your plan tackles all these things and you stay flexible, you’ll be well on your way.
