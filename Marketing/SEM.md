  Hello! By now you should have a pretty good idea of how people use lots of keywords to search for your products or services. Now let’s talk about making your keywords as effective as possible. In this video, we’ll be looking at research tools, like the ones provided by search engines like Google and Bing. We’ll see how using these tools can take some of the guesswork out of choosing keywords, and help more potential customers find you online. Let’s put this into practice. Imagine you already have one SEM campaign promoting your wedding photography business. The clients are coming in, but now let’s say you want to build a new campaign advertising your pet portraits. A tool like Google’s Keyword Planner or Bing’s Keyword Research Tool can help you find out which keywords are most relevant and will work best for your new campaign. For example, if you type in “pet portraits,” the tool will show you other related searches.

Let’s look at which of these keywords might also be a good fit for your new campaign. We can see that people search for terms like [pictures of dogs], [animal artists], and [dog portraits].

The results also show how many searches each term tends to get. And other useful information, like suggested “bid prices” and “competition levels.” Knowing this, you can create several groups, called ad groups. One for terms related to pet portraits, one for [pictures of dogs], one for [dog portraits] and one for [animal artists].

By organising these terms into ad groups, you can write relevant ads for each group of keywords. That takes care of the relevant keywords, but what about the ones that didn’t seem so relevant? For example, we can see lots of people are also searching for [pet portraits pencil], which suggests they’re looking for something else.

There are also many who are searching for watercolour pet portraits, and horse portraits, neither of which you offer. In situations like these, you should use “negative keywords” to prevent your ads from appearing when people search for things that aren’t relevant to your business. For example, [-pencil], [-pastel] and [-horse].

These negative keywords will block your ads any time a search contains one or all of them.

This is useful, because preventing adverts from appearing for irrelevant searches, is going to save you money, and make sure that only your ideal customer sees your ads.

So, to recap, keyword research tools can help you find keywords that attract customers… but they also help you discover keywords to avoid. It’s also a good idea to try and revisit these tools regularly. People’s search behavior tends to change over time, and if you let your campaigns sit untouched for too long, their performance could start to dip.

  Monitor Effectiveness through:
  - Tracking
  - Conversions
  - Online tools
  - Codes
  - Reports
  Hi there! So you’ve got some online advertising campaigns up and running and you want to find out how they’re doing?

In this video, we’ll explain how to do just that by tracking conversions. We’ll cover what they are, how to choose the ones you want to measure and what technology to use to track them.

One of the best things about SEM is that you can measure the value you’re getting from your campaigns. To do this, you track conversions - the key actions you want website visitors to take—using tools that search engines like Google or Bing provide. We’ll get to those in just a minute.

Let’s start with how you choose which conversions to track. Say you’re a nature photographer who sells prints online. What kinds of actions might count as “conversions” on your website?

Obviously, placing an order is an important one. But what else might you want people to do?

Well, your website should have a Contact form so potential customers can ask you questions like what other prints you have for sale, or if you’re available to photograph special events. When someone submits an inquiry through this form, that’s a conversion, too. What if you don’t sell prints online? Instead, you’re a wedding photographer and the bulk of your site is a portfolio of your work. You might have references in downloadable PDF form, so when people download it you can track that as a conversion.

You could also have a link people can click to receive your rates via email. That’s another way potential customers can become paying customers, so you should track that as a conversion as well. In these two examples, we’ve mentioned a handful of different conversions: successful transactions, contact form submissions, and downloads. And there are plenty of other possibilities. Can you think of what conversions you’d want to track for your own business? So how can you actually track these conversions? Well, you can use tools provided by search engines. These allow you, or whoever is managing your website for you, to place a small piece of code on certain pages of your website. That sounds complicated, especially if you don’t have any technical support, but don’t worry, we’ll walk you through it.

Let’s go back to the nature photography business. You want to track a completed order, so you need to figure out the proper place for the conversion tracking code. You wouldn’t want to put the code on your homepage—if you do that, you’ll be counting conversions every time someone visits your site.

Instead, you would install the conversion tracking code on the order confirmation page. That’s the page customers see after they complete an order. That way, you know a conversion happened. Next, you decide to track online inquiries. Just like the previous example, you need to install the conversion tracking code on a page the visitor sees only after they submit an inquiry. For example, on the page that thanks the customer after they’ve placed an order. Make sense? In order to properly track conversions, you need to attach the code to pages someone will only see after they’ve taken the action you want. Once you install the code, you’ll start getting reports that tell you how many conversions you got. That’s valuable information in figuring out if your online ad campaigns are working. To sum up: By using online tools from search engines like Bing or Google, you can measure online conversions and set yourself up for success.
