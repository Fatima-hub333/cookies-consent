  Hiya! In this lesson, we’ll introduce you to all the ways you can create an online presence—from websites and social media to local business listings and review sites.

You can see just how important it is these days to be online, so let’s get going. The most obvious way to “go digital” is with a website. Early websites weren’t much more than online brochures that described the who, what and where.

Today’s websites can do much more. Your site can help people do research, chat with experts, read customer reviews, watch videos, buy things, track orders – and much, much more. If you decide that a website makes sense for you, the key is to think about what your site actually needs to do in order to support your business goals. We’ve got a whole lesson coming up where we’ll talk about that in detail, but for now, don’t worry about whatever today’s shiny new technology is if it’s not going to directly contribute to your goals.

Of course, it’s also possible to do business online without a website. If you own a bakery, for example, you want customers to be able to find you, website or not.

Think about the last time you had a craving for a carrot cake. You probably searched for something like ‘bakery near me’ and reviewed your options.

You might see a website for a local bakery... or you might discover a good option in local listings.

Some businesses use local listings to create a digital presence, using products like Google My Business and Bing Places for Business. These types of directories let businesses publish details like descriptions, reviews, maps and images.

These listings are usually free, and are a good way to help your business appear on results pages when people search.

Beyond local listings, there may be review sites for your specific type of business where people can leave feedback — and you can respond. Rave reviews will give you the edge over the competition.

You can also use social media as your digital presence. People all over the world use Facebook and Twitter pages to complement — or in some cases replace — a website. Another way you can reach customers online is through their mobile. You’ve probably downloaded apps or games on your mobile phone. You can create and offer these apps to customers yourself.

Apps can take advantage of a mobile device’s unique capabilities, like GPS, mapping and phone, to connect with customers. If a customer installs your app on her mobile, the next time she’s near your shop, the app might send her a special offer, thanks to GPS.

Apps could even let her place an order right then, so when she comes in she can skip the queue, pick up her order and pay by tapping her mobile against the till. Mobile apps are often used as loyalty tools, to encourage existing, frequent customers to come back… and maybe get a free coffee with that carrot cake. So, to recap: whether you use a website, local business listings, social media, mobile apps, or all of the above, the trick is to decide what you want customers to do, then create a home that accomplishes those goals. Together, these things work as your digital storefront: your space to interact with customers online.

We’ve got lessons covering all of these areas, but for the next little while we’ll be focusing on websites: you'll learn the basics like how websites work, how to pick and register a proper domain name, and how to make whatever you decide to do online as friendly as possible to your digital visitors AND support the goals of your business. And if you keep watching, we’ll cover all of this and more.

  In this lesson we’ll talk you through some crucial early decisions you’ll make about your website: choosing a website name and planning how your site is structured. The goal is making it easy for customers to find their way around and get what they want. Because a happy customer equals a more successful business, right?

Ready to go?

First up, your domain name. That’s what people will type into a web browser to find you.

When choosing a domain name, you first need to check if the one you want is available. There can only be one TastyBakery.com on the web, for example, and if someone has already claimed it, you won’t be able to use it. So, how do you know if the name you want is taken? Just do a search for 'domain registrar' and click on one of the results. There should be a tool on the site that lets you see if someone is already using the name you want. And, if they are, it may suggest another similar name that’s available for you to use.

A good domain name is one that people can easily remember. Keep it as short, relevant and as to-the-point as possible.

You may be able to get a variation of the name you want by choosing a different extension, which is the fancy name for the bit at the end. You’re probably familiar with the '.com' or '.co.uk' extensions, but you might find others that are available or a better fit. For example, non-profit organizations often use '.org.' What this also means is that although 'TastyBakery.com' may be taken, 'TastyBakery.net' may still be available. OK, that’s the name sorted. Let’s have a look at some other common parts of a website, like the home page. This is the first page people see after they type in your domain name and get to your website. The home page is your shop window, where you invite people in and explain what you’re all about. A home page also directs visitors to other pages of your website through what we call 'navigation'. Your navigation headings may run across the top of a page or down the side. Either way, it’s a menu that lets people travel from one part of the site to another.

How you organise the site is very important. Start by thinking about the websites you visit regularly. How are they organised?

Now, decide what kind of content you want to offer, and then group it together in ways that make sense. Incidentally, many website-building tools offer business website templates that can help you get started.

One easy place to start? The pages and sections you see on most websites: things like 'About' and 'Contact' pages. Your website’s Contact page might include your address, phone number, email and a map with directions.

The About page might tell the story of your business and include photos of some of your best work. There’s no right or wrong way to organise a site, but you’ll always want to put yourself in your visitor’s shoes. What’s he or she looking for? What are they trying to accomplish on the website?

Now, you want to set things up so it’s super-easy for visitors to find the information they need, like the bakery’s working hours, or complete important goals, like submitting an online order.
Let’s check out what you’ll see on the pages themselves.

First, you’ll notice those navigation signposts, like the About and Contact headings. They should appear on every page of your site so that people can always get to where they want to go, or back to where they’ve been.

Of course, there will also be words, or text: headlines, paragraphs, bulleted lists. And you might also have things like images and video.

Text and images can also be set up to link to other pages on the Internet when they’re clicked. These are known as 'hyperlinks', or shortcuts to other pages either on your site or elsewhere on the web. Many websites also invite customers to interact, with features like forms to submit questions, maps with turn-by-turn directions to your store or shopping baskets to buy products directly. Your website — your digital storefront — is a great opportunity to connect with customers. Choosing the right domain name, organising the site logically and including nifty features can help your visitors find exactly what they’re looking for.
