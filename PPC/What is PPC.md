**What is PPC?**
Pay-per-click (PPC) is an advertising model that lets advertisers place ads on an advertisement platform and pay the host of the platform when their ad is clicked.

The goal of the ad is to lead the user who clicks to the advertiser's website or app, where a user can complete a valuable action such as purchasing a product.

Search Engines are popular host platforms as they allow advertisers to display ads relevant to what users are searching for.

Advertising services like Google Ads & microsoft Ads operate with real-time bidding (RTB), where advertising inventory is sold in a private automated auction using real-item data.

**How Paid Search Work?**

A combination of multiple factors, including bid amount and the quality of the ad, decide the winner who will appear in the top spot of the SERP.
These auctions are what keeps the gears of PPC moving.They begin when someone searches for something on a search engine. If there are advertisers interested in showing ads related to a user's search query, an auction is triggered based on keywords that are bid on by advertiser.

To get involved in these auctions, advertisers use accounts on platforms like Google Ads to setup their ads and determine where and when they would like those ads to appear.

Accounts are split into campaigns for ease of management and reporting of different locations, product types, or other useful categorization. Campaigns are further divided into ad groups that contain keywords and relevant ads.

*** Keywords ***
Keywords lie at the center of PPC, connecting advertisers to users search queries.
- Queries:- are the actual words that users type into the search box of a search engine to find results.
- Keywords:- on the other hand, are what marketers use to target these users by matching their search queries.

*Ads*
Along with keywords, advertisers need to prepare ads in their campaigns. These are nestled together within ad groups that target shared sets of keywords and are organized by common themes. 

Ads are what the users will see if the auction is won, so they are essential to getting right. They typically contain headlines, description lines & a url. 

On a SERP, they can show up on top of the results or at the bottom of the page. It's good practice to test different versions of ad copy to see what performs best.

- Ad extensions enhance the appearance of ads. Ad extensions are great as they increase the visibility of ads by making them more engaging to users while communicating more information.

- Examples include a) sitelink extensions, which populate an ad with more links to different pages on a site, and b) call extensions, which add a phone number to the ad during business hours.


*Budget & Bids*
To participate in the auction, advertisers need to decide how much they're willing to spend on a given keyword. This is done using budgets at a campaign level, and bids at the ad group or keyword level.

Budgets are set at the campaign level and can be exceeded daily, but will not be overspent monthly. Budgets should be set according to the overall account strategy, but bids are a more precise way of controlling apend. All ad groups must have bids, but keyword level bids override ad group bids.

*Automated Bidding Strategies*
Many advertisers use automated bidding strategies. These strategies allow advertisers to set a speific goal for their campaigns and then have the advertising platform determine the most appropriate bid for each auction. 

Bid strategies can be applied to individual campaigns or a portfolio of multiple campaigns.

Due to the RTB system, the actual amount paid by the advertiser is dependent on competitor activity and ad rank, not just the maximum bid.

*Ad Rank*
There is more to winning the auction than having the highest bid. Search engines look at other factors to determine which ads should be at the top and most valuable spot on the SERP. 

Search engines have their own particular ways of factoring in other elements to determine ad rank. For example, Google consider
- Bid Amount
- Ad relevance & Quality
- The context of the search (such as the user's device and time of day)
- Format impact(whether it includes extensions that enhance the format of the ad)

*Quality Score*
Quality score is a metric that determines ad relevance.
The components of quality score are:
- Historical Click-through-rate (CTR)
- Relevance of the keyword to the ad.
- Relevance of the keyword and ad to the search query
- Landing Page quality

It's very important to have an engaging and relevant ad copy that includes high-volume keywords.

The Web page must be relevant to the user, load quickly, and provide an overall smooth user experience.
